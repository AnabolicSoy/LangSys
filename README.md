# LangSys
Procedural Language Generation System For Game Story Telling , using UnityLibrary

All scripts are ment to be used in Unity3D , given that they all make use of the UnityLirary

At the moment the code is kind of disjointed and has basically no comments, given that I just pulled it out of the UnityProject that it was made for
trying to implement it into a new project will require understanding the ins and outs of the system, ill get to uploading a diagram that explianis the logic
behind all this.

At the moment im trying to make the code more clear and reduce the bloating, aka, merging some scripts and functions all into one, when possible

this was all made when I wasnt proficient at coding in general...
